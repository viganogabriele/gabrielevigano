Hello there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Gabriele, a 19-year-old computer engineering enthusiast from Italy.

About me Iâ€™m currently finishing my studies at the scientific high school specializing in applied sciences, where Iâ€™ve developed a strong interest in computer science and related topics. My journey into the digital world started in middle school, where I learned how to use Adobe suite, and has since been enriched through self-study and school-based programming.

My next step is to enroll in the computer engineering faculty, eager to learn as much as possible for my future. Iâ€™m open to connections on linkedin with professionals and companies in the IT sector, eager to learn from experts and share my ideas. Iâ€™m excited to face the challenges that the future holds and to turn my passion for computer science into a successful career path.
