## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Gabriele, a 19-year-old computer engineering enthusiast from Italy  

### About me
I recently graduated from the scientific high school specializing in applied sciences, where I developed a strong interest in computer science and related topics. My journey into the digital world started in middle school, where I learned how to use the Adobe suite, and has since been enriched through self-study and school-based programming.

Now, I am enrolled in the computer engineering faculty, eager to learn as much as possible for my future. Iâ€™m open to connections on LinkedIn with professionals and companies in the IT sector, eager to learn from experts and share my ideas. Iâ€™m excited to face the challenges that the future holds and to turn my passion for computer science into a successful career path.
